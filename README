GLOVSENSE

Sports glove project. Everything is built from scratch without using 
any libraries and IDEs for embedded development. The project should 
be done with an Unix, make and gnu-arm-embedded-toolchain.

The project is aimed to support accelerometer, gyrescope and blood
pressure monitoring sensors.
